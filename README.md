# Scalable-and-Cost-Effective-Deduplication-Leveraging-Algorithms-and-LLMs

SponsorMotion is a consulting and data company, founded by experienced professionals in the industry, that leverages artificial intelligence to create a comprehensive database of healthcare-related events in the United States. Their mission is to make all events easily discoverable for both sponsors and attendees, streamlining the process of connecting the right sponsors with the right events.
The goal of the project is to optimize the data ingestion process of SponsorMotion. Although the current pipeline is functional, it needs improvement to enhance the company's scalability and achieve the goal of making all US events searchable. To elaborate, the specific challenges to address are to establish a fully automated data quality control process that identifies problematic and duplicate records and to optimize the costs of post-scrape filtering and processing of event records. In the visualization below, the steps in red are the ones we will be working on.
